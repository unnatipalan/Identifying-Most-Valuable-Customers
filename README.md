# Identifying-Most-Valuable-Customers
A short exercise to identify the most valuable customers in order to provide them with discount coupons.

The data set consists of transactional data of customers including ID, the date of transaction and the amount spent. 

The approach follows these steps - 

* Defining and removing churned customers
* Creating a ranking mechanism to rank customers based on their purchase history
* Scaling features in order to establish a comparable scale
* Deciding on a threshold value to segregate the best customers
* Distributing the budget into discount coupons equally
